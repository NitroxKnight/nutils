This tutorial will assume a basic understading of:

* python 3: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/

* python numpy library https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/quickstart.html

* basic PDE's, like heat/diffusion

* Conspetial consept of Finite Element Method


This is a demonstration of the use of nutils with the use of ipython/jupther notebooks with focus on examples.

## Getting the right workvenvirment,

The easiest way to get ipython/jupther notebooks running is with a version of python from anaconda 3: https://anaconda.org/

This will install almost everything you need to get nutils running.

We only need nutils got to the nutils github page: https://github.com/nutils/nutils and downlaod the most current version

python setup.py install


This should install nutils.
